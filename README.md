# Smart-City-Air-quality-prediction-using-big-data
This project focuses on building a data-driven system to predict air quality levels in smart cities using big data technologies. The goal is to leverage large-scale, real-time environmental data to forecast pollution levels and support timely decision-making for public health and urban planning.
Overview
A big data-based project to predict air quality levels in smart cities using real-time sensor data and machine learning models.

Goal
To forecast AQI (Air Quality Index) and provide real-time insights for better urban planning and public health decisions.
